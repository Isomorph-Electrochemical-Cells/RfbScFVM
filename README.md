# RfbScFVM

The RfbScFVM model allows for transient and stationary solutions of the coupled mass, momentum, and energy densities within a single redox flow battery cell.

*Warning: The model implementation is in progress and considered experimental. The API is expected to change considerably in the near future to provide a more streamlined interface for users.*
